## Would you rather

Would you rather is a web app made using React and Redux.<br/>
It lets you connect with an user account (pre-registered) and answer polls.<br/>
You can choose between answered and non-answered questions.<br/>
The one that was already answered will show all choices made by users and the other one will let you choose between two answers.<br/>
You can navigate to the home page (by click on the name of the application), leaderboard page, create a new question and finally logout by clicking on the user avatar and select logout.
